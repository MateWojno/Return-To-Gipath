            Experimental version $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ 
            Evil Islands Multi Player Vanilla-Like Mod
            ==========================================

To-Do List:

$$$$$$$$$$$$
1/ new maps;
============
[ADDITIONAL MAP IDEAS]              > Add unused maps singeplayer maps back into multiplayer


$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
2/ new quests;
==============


- new story, the old hero died and you are his succesor;
[SIDENOTE] > Zak the old hero has lore in Allods Online, apparently he transformed into a giant octopus-monster based on the ones in Ingos. He is the main boss in the undead city raid in Allods Online. So I think the new story could maybe be focussed on the "old hero" missing?

- new/old NPC's - for example you can get the quests in Gipath from Estera and Babur;
[SIDENOTE] > Love this idea, maybe we could seperate them into vanilla quests and new ones, so the player has an easy overview?

- chain story'ish quests - /if we can access source code/ - you will get the title for example %rareEnemyName Slayer.hero.name% which will allow you to get more difficult and rewarding quests; 

- grind quests for hunting/making money and searching for crafting materials;
[SIDENOTE] > For an easy divide quests should be focussed around 3 rewards: exp/money/uniqueloot. The maps on the other hand should be focussed towards certain materials.

- higher exp quests for those who want to learn by facing the death; (LOD system)


$$$$$$$$$$$$$
3/ new items;
=============
[ADDITIONAL ITEM IDEAS]             > Spellsling (melee weapons converted so it only does damage with the spell in slot) 
                                    > Additional potions that grant magic resistances
                                    > Wands that spawn a familiar/pet (Classic mod has this feature in a skill, maybe we could make it item based)
                                    > Elemental materials - Fire/Frost/Etc weapons
                                    > GIPATH - Crossbows
                                    > INGOS - Crossbows
                                    > SUSLANGER - Bows
                                    > CAVE - Bows

[ADDITIONAL BOSS IDEAS]             > GIPATH - Pack of elder boars: 3 big boars that have a unique boar skin

- respawning friendly critters which drop resources - hunting-like experience
[ADDITIONAL CRITTER IDEAS]          > GIPATH - *Hard to implement* Flying insect (reskin of the bat model perhaps we can make the flying animation faster)
                                    > GIPATH - Red fox (reskin of the dog model)
                                    > INGOS - Snow fox (reskin of the dog model)

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
4/ gameplay balance;
====================

[ADDITIONAL BALANCE IDEAS]

- Daggers - Adding more crit chance / higher crit
- Hammers/maces - More complexity (making them viable for battlemage builds)
- Spears - Highest damage but lowest defence
- Axes - Most balanced damage/defence output
- Swords - Highest defence
- More difference between light armor and heavy armor weight
- Cloth/hide armor with high complexity for spell slot


$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
5/ gameplay testing and bug report;
===================================


$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
6/ new game mechanics;
======================

- levels mechanics, when you get certain amount of exp you are at certain lvl, players with high levels can't help low level players to cheat;

- skill inc mechanics - like in old Tibia you will be able to skill your weapons and magic;

- new defense mechanics - no more standing still with max def;

- LOD - level of difficulty, which allow to scale xp/drop and also difficulty of the game from 0.1 to 100;

- vault system - you can access patterns, materials and gold across all of your MP characters;

- Procedural Map and Enemy Creatures placement Generator - using seeds of LOD;

- changed Gipath MP Village map to include more NPC - you can access new areas of this expanded map if you have the required title or item, this will allow to track progress of a player inside MP;

- trade map or Gipath MP Village map expansion - place to trade between players;

[ADDITIONAL MECHANICS IDEAS]

- Feature fast time in multiplayer

- Summoning allies (classic mod has this feature)
